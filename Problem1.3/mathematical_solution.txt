Objective Function
	z = total sale value 
Decisition vaiable 
	c1 = the number of model 1 produced 
	c2 = the number of model 2 produced

Therefore, 
	z = 120 * the number of model 1 produced + 80 * the number of model 2 produced 
	  = 120 * c1 + 80 + c2 

Constraints 
	availability for wood: 2c1 + c2 <= 6
	availability for time: 7c1 + 8c2 <= 28


Our Model:
	maximaize z 
	subject to 
		 2c1 + c2 <= 6
		 7c1 + 8c2 <= 28

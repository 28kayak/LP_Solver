Problem
	Universal Mines Inc. operates three mines in West Virginia. The one from each mine is separated into two grades before it is shipped; the daily production capacities of the mines, as well as their daily operating costs, are as follows.

	|-------------------------------------------------------|
	|         |High-Grade Ore,|Low-Grade Ore,|Operating Cost|
	|         |  tons/day     |  tons/day    |  $1000/daily |
	|-------------------------------------------------------| 
	| Mine 1  |        4      |       4      |     20       |
	|-------------------------------------------------------|
	| Mine 2  |        6      |       4      |     22       |
	|-------------------------------------------------------|
	| Mine 3  |        1      |       6      |     18       |
	|-------------------------------------------------------|
	


Universal has committed itself to deliver 54 tons of high-grade ore and 65 tons of low-grade ore by the end of the week.
It also has labor contract that gurantee employees in each mine a full day's payy for each day or fraction of a day the mine is open. Determine the number of days each mine should be operated during the upcoming week if Universal Mines is to fullfill its commitment at minimum total cost.
